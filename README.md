## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love working on programming projects (web apps, games, ...) every now and then. Here are some of them, feel free to explore!

1. **Text2Quiz**: Generates **revision questions and flashcards** for your study materials using LLM. Supports **plaintext, document files and scanned pages** as input sources.

2. **vision-acuity-tester**: A basic, computerized, gesture-based implementation of the Landolt C chart. Does not replace actual vision tests.

4. **Space Miner**: A 2D platformer game themed around outer planet exploration and resource gathering, with five different levels and basic weaponry mechanisms. [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/nhathuy07/CodingCourseProject)

5. **Catch the Primes**: A timed game where you **catch prime numbers** with a mouse-controlled virtual pad. Featuring dreamy pixel-art visuals and soothing soundtracks. [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/nhathuy07/CatchThePrimes_Game), [(.EXE Download)](https://github.com/nhathuy07/CatchThePrimes_Game/releases/download/1.0.0/exe.win-amd64-3.10.zip)

6. **BeatCatcher**: Yet another rhythm game, where you catch colorful orbs to the rhythm of your own song. [(GitHub Repository)](https://github.com/nhathuy07/BeatCatcher), [(.EXE Download)](https://github.com/nhathuy07/BeatCatcher/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

ðŸŒ± Most of these projects are made with **Python** and **HTML/CSS/JS**, but I'm looking forward to learning a new language or two.
